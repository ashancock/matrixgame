			<div class="text-block-6">Welcome to the Matrix, a reality created and maintained by the machines. Agents, disguised as humans, police the digital world from the shadows. They can be anywhere, they can be anyone. <em>But there is a resistance growing</em>. Humanity has put forth a spark of awakening, waiting to be fanned into brilliant flames… if only it can stay lit long enough.
				<br/>‍
				<br/><strong class="bold-text">Teams / Characters</strong>‍</div>
			<ul role="list" class="list">
				<li class="list-item padding-bottom"><span class="text-span-2">Agents (blue team)</span> - Enforcers of the Matrix. They walk among the humans undetected and are able to take over any consciousness for their own evil purposes.
					<br/>
					<br/><em>The Agents win the game if they are able to successfully prevent the awakening of the One.</em></li>
				<li class="padding-bottom"><span class="text-span-3">The Resistance (red team)</span> - A small, but growing group of awakened humans. They wait for the arrival of <em>the One</em> -- the spark that will lead to their freedom from the Matrix.
					<br/>
					<br/><em>The Resistance wins the game if they are able to successfully awaken the One.</em></li>
				<li class="padding-bottom"><span class="text-span-4">The Oracle (red team)</span> - The Oracle precedes the One -- a seer born within the Matrix whose destiny is to clear the way for humanity’s last hope.
					<br/>
					<br/><em>The Oracle fights for the Resistance and is the only person who can awaken the One.</em></li>
				<li class="padding-bottom"><span class="text-span-3">The Architect (blue team)</span> - The Architect created the Matrix to enslave humanity. They want nothing but to preserve their creation. They have sensed the coming of the One and will stop at nothing to eliminate them.
					<br/>
					<br/><em>The Architect fights for the Agents and is the only entity who can kill the One.</em></li>
				<li class="padding-bottom"><span class="text-span-3">The One (red team)</span> - A human born inside the Matrix with the power to bend it to their will. They are resistant to the strength of the Agents. Unfortunately, they are not aware of their own power or purpose.
					<br/>
					<br/><em>The One fights for the Resistance, but does not know they are the One… until they begin to believe.</em></li>

				<br/>The main interaction in the game is the <em>face off</em>: players challenge each other to a duel.

				<li class="padding-bottom">If you face off with a member of the same team, you are safe! Now is a good time to exchange intel. Who do you know is part of the opposing team? Do you suspect anyone to be the One?</li>
				<li class="padding-bottom">Turned members retain their memory. Be careful!</li>
				<li class="padding-bottom">After facing off, you will be locked from facing off again for 2 minutes while the tracing program regains your signature.</li>
				<li class="padding-bottom">The game ends when there are 5 or fewer Resistance left (including the Oracle) or when the Game Master calls the game as over.</li>
				<li class="padding-bottom">At this point the Oracle and the Architect must guess who is the One using intel from their team. Whoever guesses correctly wins. In the event of a tie, there will be a tie-breaker.</li>
